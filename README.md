You like 3d modelling, but don't like using a GUI. Good for you! But which modeller do you use??
You'll have to figure that out for yourself, but here are some options.

## Special mention

### [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/)
- [Repo](https://github.com/openscad/openscad)
- [Community](http://www.openscad.org/community.html)
- [Docs](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html)

The rest of the packages are in alphabetical order, but OpenScad gets a special mention because it's the OG. Many of the projects below were inspired by OpenScad and is the most well-known choice. If you're new to code-cad this is the safest choice, even if only from tutorials and content perspective.

### [OpenCascade](https://www.opencascade.com/)
- [Repo](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce)
- [Community](https://dev.opencascade.org/)
- [Docs](https://old.opencascade.com/doc/occt-6.9.1/refman/html/index.html)

It's a c++ library that a number the projects below wrap. OpenCascade uses a Boundary representation (B-rep) kernel, which is a powerful way representing solid geometry, this is a point of difference for some many of the other projects that use a polygon mesh.

CadQuery is a Python library that wraps and extends [OpenCascade](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce). It has a philosophy of capturing design intent. The API has been designed to be as close as possible to how you‚Äôd describe the object to a human. An example of this is its ability to "select" parts of the model's geometry to run operations on, such as the following code that selects only the edges running along the Z-axis and fillets them.

```python
result = cq.Workplane("XY" ).box(3, 3, 0.5).edges("|Z").fillet(0.125)
```

Curv is a programming language for creating art using mathematics. It‚Äôs a 2D and 3D geometric modelling tool that supports full colour, animation and 3D printing. It was inspired by OpenScad and [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

FreeCad is a more traditional CAD package that supports python scripting, Both for modelling as well as controlling the FreeCAD GUI itself. Not only that it has a built in [OpenScad workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/OpenSCAD_Module) as well as an external [CadQuery workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/CadQuery_Workbench), making it the best in this list at interoperability. FreeCAD uses OpenCascade under-the-hood.

Inspired by OpenScad with a very similar language, implemented in Haskell and includes the ability to write definitions in Haskell, instead of just OpenSCAD, and is part of an 'almost stack' of tools including ExplicitCAD (for a GUI), and HSlice (for an STL slicer).

JSCAD (formally know as OpenJSCAD) provides a programmer‚Äôs approach to develop 3D models. In particular, this functionality is tuned towards creating precise models for 3D printing.

JSCAD provides the ability to:
- Create and manipulate 3D models, as well as 2D models
- Use JavaScript programming concepts, and libraries
- Save 3D models as STL (and other) formats

JSCAD is available as a:
- [Website](www.jscad.xyz)
- Command line application for backend processing
- User application
- Set of packages (libraries) for building custom applications

JSCAD allows anyone to create 3D (or 2D) designs by combining simple shapes. And any shape can be rotated, moved, scaled, etc. Complex shapes can be saved as parts, which can used later. And the final design can be exported into various standard formats, i.e. STL, DXF, SVG, etc.

Another project inspired by OpenScad. The author considers key differences to be procedural vs functional programming language style, (i.e variables can be modified) and the use of arbitrary precision arithmetic throughout (meaning there are no unexpected double/float rounding errors). There is a handy [feature matrix](https://github.com/GilesBathgate/RapCAD/blob/master/doc/feature_matrix.asciidoc) between RapCAD, OpenScad and ImplicitCad.
