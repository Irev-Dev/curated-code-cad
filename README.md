You like 3d modelling, but don't like using a GUI. Good for you! But which modeller do you use??
You'll have to figure that out for yourself, but here are some options.

## Special mention

### [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/)
The rest of the packages are in alphabetical order, but OpenScad gets a special mention because it's the OG. Many of the projects below were inspired by OpenScad and is the most well-known choice. If you're new to code-cad this is the safest choice, even if only from tutorials and content perspective.

### [OpenCascade](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce)
It's a c++ library that a number the projects below wrap.

Know of a package that we missed? tell us with an issue or open up a PR.
The description for each package is pretty minimal at the moment. If you'd like to add more detail to any of them please go ahead.

## Here they are:

### [CadQuery](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html)

CadQuery is a Python library that wraps and extends [OpenCascade](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce). It aims to let you model as "close as possible to how you‚Äôd describe the object to a human".

### [CascadeStudio](https://zalo.github.io/CascadeStudio/)

A javascript wrapper for [OpenCascade](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce) that runs in the browser. (OpenCascade can run in the browser when compiled to web-assembly).

### [Curv](http://www.curv3d.org/)

Curv is a programming language for creating art using mathematics. It‚Äôs a 2D and 3D geometric modelling tool that supports full colour, animation and 3D printing. It was inspired by OpenScad and [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/).

### [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/)

FreeCad is a more traditional CAD package that supports python scripting, Both for modelling as well as controlling the FreeCAD GUI itself. Not only that it has a built in [OpenScad workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/OpenSCAD_Module) as well as an external [CadQurey workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/CadQuery_Workbench), making it the best in this list at interoperability.

### [implicitCAD](http://www.implicitcad.org/)

Inspired by OpenScad with a very similar language, implemented in Haskell.

### [JSCAD](https://openjscad.org/)

Formerly OpenJsCad, also inspired by OpenScad. The project is close to a v2.0 release. Implemented in javascript allowing it to be modelled directly within a browser.

### [libfive](http://libfive.com/)

libfive is a software library and set of tools for solid modelling, especially suited for parametric and procedural design. lisp based language, (so (you (((((can expect ) lots of brakets))))).

### [pythonOCC](http://www.pythonocc.org/)

Python-based, Also uses [OpenCascade](https://github.com/tpaviot/oce).

### [RapCAD](https://gilesbathgate.com/category/rapcad/)

Another project inspired by OpenScad.

### [ShapeScript](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shapescript/id1441135869?mt=12)

Mac App

### [SolidPython](https://solidpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Python-based library that wraps OpenScad, i.e. it outputs OpenScad code.

## Node editors

Not quiet Code-Cad, but they do embody much of the same thought process.

### [DynFreeCAD](https://github.com/infeeeee/DynFreeCAD)

Works with FreeCad

### [Sverchok](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok)

Add-on for blender. Sverchok is a powerful parametric tool for architects, allowing geometry to be programmed visually with nodes.
